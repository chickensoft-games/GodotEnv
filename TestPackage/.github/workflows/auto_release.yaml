# This workflow will run whenever tests finish running. If tests pass, it will
# look at the last commit message to see if it contains the phrase
# "chore(deps): update all dependencies".
#
# If it finds a commit with that phrase, and the testing workflow has passed,
# it will automatically release a new version of the project by running the
# publish workflow.
#
# The commit message phrase above is always used by renovatebot when opening
# PR's to update dependencies. If you have renovatebot enabled and set to
# automatically merge in dependency updates, this can automatically release and
# publish the updated version of the project.
#
# You can disable this action by setting the DISABLE_AUTO_RELEASE repository
# variable to true.
